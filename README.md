## 🧩 UI Component Patterns

We are using reusable and scalable UI components:

- **Navbar** – Site-wide navigation with responsive design
- **Property Card** – Property previews for list/grid display
- **Footer** – Informational links and social icons
- **Buttons** – Consistent action buttons (primary/secondary)
- **Search/Filter Bar** – For advanced property filtering
- **Booking Summary** – Booking details shown at checkout
- **Image Carousel** – Gallery for detailed property views

> Reusable components speed up development and keep the UI consistent.
